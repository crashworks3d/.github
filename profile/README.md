# Welcome to Crash Works 3D!

Imagine having the ability to bring your favorite comic book character to life through your cosplay props and costumes. At Crash Works 3D, we are a group of passionate designers, engineers, hobbyists, and enthusiasts just like you, and we share your excitement for creating solutions to problems that help you excel and remove obstacles.

Our mission is to help you take your cosplay to the next level by providing you with the tools and resources you need to motorize and add special effects to your Iron Man helmets and other props. We have developed and supported multiple code repositories such as Iron_Man_Servo, which has already enabled countless hobbyists to bring their Iron Man costumes to life.
